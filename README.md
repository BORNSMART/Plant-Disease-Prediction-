# Plant-Disease-Prediction-
Plant Disease Prediction using a deep learning model to classify 38 plant categories, including healthy and diseased plants like Apple scab, Potato blight, and Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus. Built with TensorFlow, it helps in early detection by making predictions from input images, achieving 99.7% accuracy.

## Overview
This project provides a deep learning solution to classify plant diseases using images. The model identifies 38 different plant classes, including both healthy plants and various diseases. It helps in early disease detection for plant species such as apples, grapes, tomatoes, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset contains images from 38 classes, including:
- **Apple**: scab, Black rot, Cedar apple rust, healthy
- **Corn**: Cercospora leaf spot, Common rust, Northern Leaf Blight, healthy
- **Tomato**: Early blight, Late blight, Leaf Mold, Target Spot, Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, healthy

## Model
The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow, designed to classify plant diseases. The images are resized to 128x128 and passed through several convolutional and fully connected layers for classification.
